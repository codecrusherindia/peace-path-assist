# Codecrush MindCare — General Project Information

Short summary
-------------
Codecrush MindCare is a hackathon project that aims to be a holistic mental‑wellness platform. Its initial focus is delivering a fast, usable MVP that lets people quickly capture mood and journaling entries and access short, actionable resources. The project is deliberately modular so other capabilities (backend, analytics, integrations) can be added after the hackathon.

Core purpose
------------
- Provide a low‑friction way for users to record and reflect on mood and feelings.  
- Offer curated, bite‑sized resources (breathing exercises, short reads, audio) to support immediate wellbeing.  
- Deliver a clear, accessible experience that encourages daily use and habit formation.  

MVP scope (what the hackathon will prioritize)
----------------------------------------------
- Quick mood entry and simple journaling.  
- A minimal resource library (text/audio) with easy access.  
- Lightweight local persistence or a minimal backend to store entries (can be expanded later).  
- Clean, accessible UI focused on low cognitive load.  

Planned future additions (post‑hackathon)
----------------------------------------
- Full backend API and user authentication.  
- Analytics and insights (trend visualizations, export).  
- Notifications/reminders and personalization.  
- Data export/import and privacy controls.  
- Mobile platform support or PWA capabilities.  

Design & development principles
-------------------------------
- Minimal friction: interactions should take seconds, not minutes.  
- Accessibility: readable, keyboard- and screen-reader-friendly UI.  
- Privacy-first: treat personal data as sensitive and design controls accordingly.  
- Iterative: ship small increments and expand features based on user feedback.

This project is built with:
- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

Target users
------------
- People who want a simple, private way to track mood and reflect regularly.  
- Hackathon judges and early adopters looking for a polished, thoughtful mental‑wellness prototype.

Status
------
- Hackathon MVP in active development. Core frontend components and UX flows are the primary focus for the event; backend and extended features are planned for subsequent iterations.
